# Chatbot_using_nlp
 
the intent is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvinagammed/chatbots-intent-recognition-dataset. 
i drew my inspiration from https://www.youtube.com/@patloeber.
I used the tensorflow framework and used two intent files, the original intent file was used in 'chatbot_intentss.py' and json file is 'intentss.json'
the other intent file 'intent.json' was edited by me to add and remove some texts and it was also made simpler and used in the 'chatbot_nlp_tensorflow.py'.
the 'my_model.h5' is from the 'chatbot_nlp_tensorflow.py' and i used it for deployment in 'deploy_chatbot.py'.  
the model 'smodel.h5' is from the 'chatbot_intentss.py'.
i tried to give a brief summary in the code if it is needed.
